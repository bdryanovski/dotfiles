### Run specific package
The dotfiles are build with the idea that multiple packages could be run one at the time without depending much on other packages.

This is not true for all packages but in general this is the idea.

To run a package just mention his name as first argument:

```bash
bash init.sh shell
```

The above command will run only the `shell` package and nothing more.

### Helpers

Helpers is a collections of useful functions that are used across packages - this way a single change could be apply to multiple files, keep everything the same, and simplify a lot of clunky BASH functionality.




### Packages

Packages are located inside `packages` folder. Everyone must include `init.sh` script, everything inside it is optional.

The basic structure is that every package support few things as commands:

  * help - provide description of the package usage
  * version - give information about the package version
  * setup - the initial task to be run without any arguments
  * sync - syncing the current stage of the computer with the package - (they way to move things between machines)
